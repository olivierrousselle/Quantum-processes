# Quantum processes
Those files present the simulation of quantum processes involved in the GBAR experiment at CERN: 
initial velocity distribution, amplitudes of the gravitational quantum states (GQS), number of atoms detected, Fourier transform of the GQS wave functions, and velocity distribution at the end of the bouncing miror.
Moreover, we implement HPC methods to improve the speed of the simulations: use of numba high-performance compiler, parallelization on CPUs, parallelization on GPUs with CUDA,...
